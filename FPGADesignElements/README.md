# Yosys vs FPGA Design Elements (online book)

Here, verilog examples of this online book are downloaded and synthesized/implemented with
Yosys/Vivado.

> Now, there are several iverilog complains about *repeat may not be zero/negative*.

## Instructions

* The first time (or when there is a message about examples not found), run: `make examples`
* With `make` or `make iverilog` the list of selected Verilog files are analyzed with the iverilog
simulator.
